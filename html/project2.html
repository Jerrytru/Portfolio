    <h1>Image Classifier</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The ocean is filled with thousands of different creatures and it is extremely difficult to remember what species they are and what they look like. This application allows you to upload an image to identify an unknown species.
    Process
    <br>
    <br>
    I used React as the framework of the application and TensorFlow to identify the species.
    <br>
    <br>
    The application consists of four states. Each state is triggered by an action that transitions to the next state.
    <br>
    <br>
    State 1.
    <br>
    The initial button triggers the TensorFlow model to load and saves it to the component state.
    <br>
    <br>
    State 2.
    <br>
    Once the model is loaded, the user can upload an image and it is converted to an object URL. The object URL is used as the src property of an IMG file to display.
    <br>
    <br>
    State 3.
    <br>
    The image is passed to the model to classify the species and store the result into state.
    <br>
    <br>
    State 4.
    <br>
    The final state displays the result and clears the image URL. Then transitions back to the image upload, since the model is already loaded into state.
